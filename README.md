# TikTakToe_Camels1

# Prerequisites:

### Python version of 3.6 or later should be installed and either IDLE or VSC should be downloaded onto your computer for the files to be opened into.

# How to download:

### Under the main site of our Github repository, you will see a big green button called "Code", click on it, but make sure you are under the main branch of our repository. After that, a little pop-up menu will appear, click on "Download ZIP" at the bottom.

### Your laptop's browser will began to download the files onto your computer. Next, either click on the downloads button on your browser and drag the files on to your desktop, or go through the file finder and click on "TikTakToe_Camels1-main" in the downloads folder.

# How to run the game:

### After the folder is on your laptop, find the file that says "tic_tac_toe.py" and open it in your preferred python code editor.

### If using IDLE, select the "run" command at the top of the page and then hit "run module".

### If using VisualStudioCode, hit the green arrow at the top right corner and follow the game in the output tab.

### If you would rather run the game in your terminal, then open up a terminal shell window and change the current directory to our file that you have just downloaded. You can change directories by using the command "cd " followed by the name of the directory that you wiould like to switch to. Once the current directory is "TikTakToe_Camels1-main", then run the command "python tic_tac_toe.py" to start the game.

### Once the game has started read the intro, and follow the instructions on the Wiki page of our Github repository.

# How to test the Game:

### To put tic_tac_toe.py into "test mode", open the program in an editing window and comment out the very last line (313) so it reads #play_tic_tac_toe(). Save the file.

### This allows just the functions being tested to run.

### Then, open the Test.py file and run it. Note that running this program in the command line is not recommended, rather run it in your editor (Module in IDLE).

# How to Find Game Logs:

### Game logs are automatically generated in a file called 'game_log.log' in the same folder that you downloaded the game in.

### The log file reports game events such as player data and turns as well as any errors/misinputs encountered.
